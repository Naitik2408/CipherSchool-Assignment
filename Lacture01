Objects
An object is an entity that has state and behavior. It can be physical, like a chair, bike, or car, or logical, like a banking system. Objects have properties (state) and actions (behavior).

Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties. It is a logical entity and cannot be physical. In Java, a class can contain:

Fields: Variables to hold data.
Methods: Functions to define behaviors.
Constructors: Special methods to initialize objects.
Blocks: Sections of code for initialization.
Nested Class and Interface: Classes and interfaces defined within another class.
