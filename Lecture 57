GRAPSH----

Graphs in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are versatile structures used to represent networks or relationships between entities. Here’s a comprehensive overview covering various aspects of graphs:
Graph: A graph 
𝐺
G is a pair 
(v,e)

(V,E) where 
𝑉
V is a set of vertices (nodes) and 
𝐸
E is a set of edges that connect these vertx

Vertex (Node): Represents an entity or object.

Edge: Represents a relationship or connection between two vertices.


TYPES OF GRAPh->

Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs:

Unweighted Graph: Edges do not have weights or costs associated with them.
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or costs that represent some numerical value (e.g., distance, cost).

Cyclic vs. Acyclic Graphs:

Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex).
Acyclic Graph: Does not contain any cycles.

Directed  graph 
Undirected graph

Graph Operations and Algorithms
Traversal Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far along each branch as possible before backtracking.
