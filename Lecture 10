method overiding 

practice code->
class Shape{
    void fun(){
        System.out.println("it  is Shape");
    }
}
class  Circle extends Shape{
    void fun(){
        System.out.println("it is a circle which overide the shape ");
    }
}


public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle c = new Circle();
        c.fun();
    }
}

output->
it is a circle which overide the shape 

// uses of final keyword to stop method overiding

practice code 3 ->
class Shape{
  final  void fun(){ 
        System.out.println("it  is Shape");
    }
}
class  Circle extends Shape{
    void fun(){// this will give an error because we have use the final keyword in the method fun()
        System.out.println("it is a circle which overide the shape ");
    }
}


public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle c = new Circle();
        c.fun();
    }
}


// simlarly if we make class as a final we cannot inherent another class from it if we do it will give an error
